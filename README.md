## Set up

1. Click the `Use this Template` button or `git clone https://github.com/cmacdonnacha/awesome-address-book.git awesome-address-book`
2. `cd my-app`
3. `npm install`
4. That's it! See the **Available Commands** list below.

&nbsp;

## Available Commands

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. Use `npm run test:no-watch` to run tests without a watcher.<br />

### `npm test:no-watch`

Runs tests without a watcher.

### `npm test:coverage`

Displays the code coverage within the console and also generates a coverage folder.

> To view the code coverage report in your browser open the `index.html` file within the `coverage/lcov-report` folder.

### `npm run lint`

Runs the ESLint typescript code lint checker. Running `npm run lint:fix` will automatically fix any lint errors where possible.

### `npm run build`

Builds a production version of the app inside the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run analyze`

This will run a production build and then analyze the output using [source-map-explorer] which analyzes JavaScript bundles using the source maps. This helps you understand where code bloat is coming from.

&nbsp;

## CI/CD

This project uses [Github actions]([github-actions]) to continuously test, build and deploy. You can see the workflow file in the [workflows](.github/workflows/continuous-integration-workflow.yml) folder.
