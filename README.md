## Live Demo

[Check out the live demo](https://cmacdonnacha.github.io/awesome-address-book/)

&nbsp;

## Set up

1. `git clone https://github.com/cmacdonnacha/awesome-address-book.git awesome-address-book`
2. `cd awesome-address-book`
3. `npm install`
4. That's it! See the **Available Commands** list below.

&nbsp;

## Available Commands

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Runs unit and integration tests in watch mode. Use `npm run test:no-watch` to run tests without a watcher.<br />

### `npm run test:no-watch`

Runs unit and integrations tests without a watcher.

### `npm run test:coverage`

Displays the code coverage within the console and also generates a coverage folder.

> To view the code coverage report in your browser open the `index.html` file within the `coverage/lcov-report` folder.

### `npm run test:e2e`

Runs end-to-end tests using [Cypress][cypress]. This will run using the Electron (headless) browser which comes with Cypress. You can also view the latest test runs online via this project's [Cypress Dashboard](https://dashboard.cypress.io/projects/qcywts/runs)

### `npm run test:open`

Runs end-to-end tests and opens a window to see the results running on your machine.

### `npm run lint`

Runs the ESLint typescript code lint checker. Running `npm run lint:fix` will automatically fix any lint errors where possible.

### `npm run build`

Builds a production version of the app inside the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run analyze`

This will run a production build and then analyze the output using [source-map-explorer] which analyzes JavaScript bundles using the source maps. This helps you understand where code bloat is coming from.

&nbsp;

## CI/CD

This project uses [Github actions]([github-actions]) to continuously test, build and deploy. You can see the workflow file in the [workflows](.github/workflows/continuous-integration-workflow.yml) folder.
